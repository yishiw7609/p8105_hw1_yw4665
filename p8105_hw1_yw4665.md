### Problem 0.1 & 0.2

All requirements and recommendations from Problem 0.1 and 0.2 are
properly followed

### Problem 1

Load the ‘moderndive’ library:

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

Load the according dataset. Use ‘help()’ to see dataset description and
variable names:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
help("early_january_weather")
```

From the RStudio Help panel, we can see that this dataset includes:

**origin**: Weather station.

**year, month, day, hour**: Time of recording.

**temp, dewp**: Temperature and dewpoint in F.

**humid**: Relative humidity.

**wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust**: Wind direction (in degrees), speed
and gust speed (in mph).

**precip**: Precipitation, in inches.

**pressure**: Sea level pressure in millibars.

**visib**: Visibility in miles.

**time_hour**: Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.

Now we use ‘nrow()’ and ‘ncol()’ to see the size of the dataset:

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

Now we use ‘mean()’ to see the mean temperature:

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

Next, we make scatter plot using ‘ggplot2’ package. First load
‘ggplot2’:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

Now we create a scatterplot named “plot_time_temp” with proper titles
and different colorings based on humid variable.

``` r
plot_time_temp = ggplot(
  early_january_weather, 
  aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time",
       x = "Time (hour)",
       y = "Temperature (F)",
       )
plot_time_temp
```

![](p8105_hw1_yw4665_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->
From the plot we can see that the temperature forms a clear periodic
pattern, where the temperature drops overnight and rises during daytime.
Overall, both temperature and humidity increases from new year to
January 15th as the spikes are getting larger and the scatters are
becoming lighter.

Finally, to save this scatterplot with ‘ggsave’:

``` r
ggsave(filename = "temp_vs_time.png", plot = plot_time_temp)
```
